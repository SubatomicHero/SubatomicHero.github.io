This is just an introductory blog to say "Hello!". I will be blogging twice weekly discussing changes that affect my professional and personal world of coding.

Whilst working, I enjoy working and developing on the [AWS][aws] platforms and trying, where possible, to fully utilise the features they have to offer.

At home, I am an avid gamer. I have already released a game on both the [Amazon][amazon-app-link] and [Google-Play][google-play-link] stores and hope to start working on another very soon, once I have an idea of what to develop that is.
